                In the cold, desolate landscape of Europa, a figure stood alone. She was known only as the Exo Stranger, a mysterious time-traveler with no Ghost at her side.
                "Time is a funny thing," she mused, her voice echoing in the silence. "It's always moving, always changing. But some things... some things are constant."     
                Suddenly, a group of Fallen attacked. The Exo Stranger was ready. Her pulse rifle, No Time to Explain, hummed with energy as she took them down one by one.              
                As the last Fallen fell, the Exo Stranger looked around. "Time may change, but the fight... the fight is always the same."             
                She disappeared then, her form fading away as if she was never there. But her words lingered, a reminder of the constant battle against the Darkness.
