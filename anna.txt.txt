                On the red sands of Mars, Ana Bray, a Hunter and a member of the legendary Bray family, was on a mission. Her Ghost, Jinju, was by her side.
                "Ana, we've got incoming," Jinju warned, her sensors picking up a group of Cabal.        
                Ana grinned, her hand instinctively going to her scout rifle, the BrayTech RWP Mk. II. "Let's give them a warm welcome."             
                She moved like a storm, her Solar energy lighting up the Martian landscape. Her Golden Gun was a beacon of hope, a testament to the Light of the Guardians.           
                As the dust settled, Ana looked around. "Mars is safe, for now," she said, her voice filled with determination. "But we'll be ready when they come back."             
                And so, she continued her watch, her heart filled with the love for her home planet. She was a Guardian, a protector, and she would stop at nothing to keep Mars safe.
